# inventory-manager
Android app developed in Android Studio with Java and with a group of 5 members for a class project. A lot of the back-end as well as all of the networking code was implemented by me.

You should be able to easily take a look at the project from within Android Studio by opening it as a project.

If you would like to use this app's networking abilities, please make sure to run the server (the files of which are located [here](https://github.com/raff766/inventory-manager-server)) as a separate Java program and change the ip address that the client is supposed to connect to from within the [client class](https://github.com/raff766/inventory-manager/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/inventoryapplication/networking/Client.java).
